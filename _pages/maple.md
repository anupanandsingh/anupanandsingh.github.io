The **Ma**thematical **P**hysics at **Le**eds Seminar Series is aimed at bringing together researchers at any level from across the University of Leeds — from both mathematics and physics departments alike — to give talks on themes in mathematical physics, broadly construed. On occasion, we also host seminars by researchers from outside the University of Leeds. Talks are typically held from 10:00 to 11:00 every other Tuesday during term time in the MALL on Level 8 in the main building of the School of Mathematics.

The series is being organised by **<a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/14138/dr-linden-disney-hogg" target="_self">Linden Disney-Hogg</a>** and **<a href="https://anupanand.space/" target="_self">Anup Anand Singh</a>**. Slides/notes from the talks will be made available on the **<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/files/19:6744754bd5754d0294a5d896b2203e8a@thread.v2?ctx=chat" target="_self">MaPLe Teams chat</a>**. If you would like to give a seminar or want to be added to the chat and the mailing list, just drop an email to **a.l.disney-hogg[at]leeds.ac.uk** or **mmaasi[at]leeds.ac.uk**.

The quest to understand out-of-equilibrium behaviour of complex quantum systems represents one of the frontiers of contemporary quantum science. For a long time, the prevailing belief has been that complex quantum systems, comprising many interacting degrees of freedom, all suffer the same inevitable fate: that of thermalisation, whereby the system relaxes towards a featureless thermal state, completely "forgetting" its initial condition. However, a flurry of recent works has unearthed a new paradigm of behaviour in many well-known physical systems, including Rydberg atoms, lattice gauge theories, and certain kinds of frustrated magnets. Such systems have been understood to possess a subtle breakdown of ergodicity, now commonly known as "quantum many-body scars".  Quantum many-body scars exhibit fascinating properties, such as extreme sensitivity to initial conditions: while a system initialised randomly undergoes chaotic dynamics and thermalisation, specific initial conditions can result in persistent dynamical revivals, surpassing native thermalisation timescales. The discovery of quantum many-body scars has not only deepened our understanding of many-body quantum mechanics, but it also has direct practical relevance for improving the control over the delicate physical phenomena underpinning quantum technologies. In this talk, I will present a pedagogical overview of this fascinating new field of physics, highlighting a few of the remaining mysteries for theory and future experiments.

The induced connection is a natural connection on a subbundle of a vector bundle. In physics, it is known as the Berry connection, and its parallel transport operators give rise to the Berry phase. In this talk I will explain exactly what the Berry/induced connection is and present some work I have done on finding numerical approximations to its parallel transport. This will lead to some interesting(?) questions for the algebraists in the audience!

Vortices are 2-dimensional topological solitons defined on a Riemann surface in the context of the Abelian Higgs model. Physically, they model magnetic flux tubes in superconductors. At critical coupling, they satisfy a 1st order system of PDEs called the Bogomolny equations. I will first review the derivation of these equations using a Bogomolny argument, and then derive the Taubes equation. Next, I will introduce a generalised Abelian Higgs energy functional, which gives rise to 5 different vortex equations (this has been carefully investigated by Nicholas Manton). For a constant curvature base surface, these equations turn out to be integrable, reducing to a Liouville equation. One can obtain further integrable vortex equations by choosing suitable conformal factors, and in this case, the Taubes equation becomes the sinh-Gordon or Tzitzeica equation. If we assume radial symmetry, these are equivalent to a Painlevé III ODE. I will discuss the construction of these vortices for the rest of the talk, which is a joint work with Maciej Dunajski.
