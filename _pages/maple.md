The **Ma**thematical **P**hysics at **Le**eds Seminar Series is aimed at bringing together researchers at any level from across the University of Leeds — from both mathematics and physics departments alike — to give talks on themes in mathematical physics, broadly construed. On occasion, seminars also include those by researchers from outside the University of Leeds.

The series was co-founded, and organised between February 2024 and May 2025, by **<a href="https://disneyhogg.github.io/personal_webpage/index.html" target="_self">Linden Disney-Hogg</a>** and me. A list of all MaPLe seminars held in this period can be found **<a href="https://anupanand.space/maple/past" target="_self">here</a>**.
