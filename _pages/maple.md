The **Ma**thematical **P**hysics at **Le**eds Seminar Series is aimed at bringing together researchers at any level from across the University of Leeds — from both mathematics and physics departments alike — to give talks on themes in mathematical physics, broadly construed. On occasion, we also host seminars by researchers from outside the University of Leeds. Talks are typically held from 10:00 to 11:00 every other Tuesday during term time in the MALL on Level 8 in the main building of the School of Mathematics.

The series is being organised by **<a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/14138/dr-linden-disney-hogg" target="_self">Linden Disney-Hogg</a>** and **<a href="https://anupanand.space/" target="_self">Anup Anand Singh</a>**.
