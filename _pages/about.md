Physics and mathematics inspire each other in beautiful ways. It is this interplay between the two that draws me to integrability, the broad area of my research. An integrable system -- characterised by a set of equations that can be "solved exactly" -- is highly symmetrical and has fascinating mathematical structures. And while integrability in the natural world is rare, it offers valuable insights into the fundamental principles underlying the laws of nature. 

My work revolves around what are called classical integrable theories and is aimed at creating a framework for their covariant quantisation. At present, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Geometry and Mathematical Physics group at Loughborough University, where I am mentored by **<a href="https://matsvermeeren.xyz" target="_self">Mats Vermeeren</a>**. My work is supported by the EPSRC project grant **<a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FY006712%2F1" target="_self">Lagrangian Multiforms for Symmetries and Integrability: Classification, Geometry, and Applications</a>**. From July 2022 to September 2025, I was a PhD student in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds, supported by an **<a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=studentship-2704447" target="_self">EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership Studentship</a>**. With my doctoral supervisors **<a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/4011/dr-vincent-caudrelier" target="_self">Vincent Caudrelier</a>** and **<a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/4034/dr-derek-harland" target="_self">Derek Harland</a>**, and our collaborators, I constructed a novel variational framework of what we call geometric Lagrangian one-forms for describing hierarchies of large classes of finite-dimensional integrable systems.

I am on the editorial board of the **<a href="https://www.mfo.de/outreach-media/snapshots" target="_self">Snapshots of Modern Mathematics From Oberwolfach</a>**, an outreach initiative of the Mathematisches Forschungsinstituts Oberwolfach. I also review articles for **<a href="https://www.ams.org/mr-database" target="_self">AMS Mathematical Reviews</a>**.
