Physics and mathematics inspire each other in beautiful ways. It is this interplay between the two that draws me to integrability, the broad area of my research. An integrable system -- characterised by a set of equations that can be "solved exactly" -- is highly symmetrical and has fascinating mathematical structures. And while integrability in the natural world is rare, it offers great insights into the fundamental principles underlying the laws of nature. I am currently trying to further our understanding of what are called classical integrable theories and devise a framework for their covariant quantisation.
