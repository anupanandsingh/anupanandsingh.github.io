<h4>Lagrangian multiforms, integrability, and quantisation</h4>

Much of my ongoing work is rooted in three major themes: the **<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01076717" target="_self">$$r$$-matrix</a>** approach to integrable systems, the theory of **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4086" target="_self">Lagrangian multiforms</a>**, and the **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02289" target="_self">gauge-theoretic origins</a>** of integrable structures. During my doctoral studies at the University of Leeds under the supervision of Vincent Caudrelier and Derek Harland, I developed a framework for systematically constructing Lagrangian multiforms, objects that provide a variational description of integrable hierarchies through a generalised action and a variational principle. In the following two papers, we used the theory of Lie dialgebras to achieve this goal for a large class of finite-dimensional integrable systems:

More recently, we constructed a Lagrangian multiform for the Hitchin integrable system using gauge-theoretic ideas:

**<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05127" target="_self">arXiv:2509.05127</a>**

The Hitchin system is related to vector bundles on Riemann surfaces and unifies many interesting integrable models. A related long*ish*-term goal is to use our construction together with the path integral formalism to tackle the quantisation of integrable hierarchies.

<!-- Much of my current work is rooted in the **<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01076717" target="_self">$$r$$-matrix</a>** approach to integrable systems and the theory of **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4086" target="_self">Lagrangian multiforms</a>**. Together with my doctoral supervisors and our collaborators, I am developing a framework for systematically constructing Lagrangian multiforms, objects that provide a variational description of integrable hierarchies through a generalised action and a variational principle. Incorporating ingredients and ideas from the Hamiltonian framework for integrability -- in particular, the theory of Lie dialgebras -- we have achieved this for a large class of finite-dimensional integrable systems. At the moment, I am working towards incorporating affine models into our framework. A related long*ish*-term goal is to use our construction together with the path integral formalism to quantise integrable field theories in a covariant manner. -->

<!--Much of my current work is based on three themes: r-matrix, multiforms, and gauge theories. A major component of this work is developing framework for constructing multiforms. Using dialgebras, here are the papers. Currently, exploring BF and Hitchin. An underlying motivation is quantisation. -->

<h4>Causal set theory</h4>

As a visiting scholar at the Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, I worked on **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11544" target="_self">causal set theory</a>**, an approach to quantum gravity that postulates that spacetime is fundamentally discrete and replaces the spacetime continuum with locally finite posets. If one were to randomly pick a poset from the space of all finite posets, it would far more likely be non-manifold-like. This poses a challenge to causal set theory, since one expects continuum-like dynamics to arise in its classical limit. A **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07623" target="_self">result</a>** from my collaboration with Dr. Abhishek Mathur and Prof. Sumati Surya helped establish that certain classes of non-manifold-like causal sets are suppressed in the causal set path sum despite being more typical that manifold-like ones, making the emergence of manifold-like behavior possible without any restrictions.

<h4>Black holes, information scrambling, and quantum chaos</h4>

For my **<a href="http://dr.iiserpune.ac.in:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/1047/MS%20Thesis%20-%20Anup%20Anand%20Singh.pdf" target="_self">MS thesis</a>** work done under the supervision of Prof. Spenta Wadia at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR), Bengaluru, I tried to better understand the **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2096" target="_self">scrambling of information</a>** by black holes using ideas from holography, quantum information and chaotic dynamics. I focused, in particular, on the **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07818" target="_self">Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model</a>**, a strongly coupled, quantum many-body system that is **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01409" target="_self">maximally chaotic</a>**, nearly conformally invariant, and exactly solvable, properties that make it interesting from the point of view of holography. A new result from my MS project was a derivation of the effective action of a charged version of the SYK model achieved by reducing the original theory of Majorana fermions to a theory of bilocal fields.
